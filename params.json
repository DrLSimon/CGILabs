{"name":"CGILabs","tagline":"","body":"# CGILabs\r\nThis is an OpenGL Lab for students in the computer science department at ENSICAEN, an engineering scool in Caen, Normandy, France. They can of course, be used by any \r\nother students willing to learn OpenGL (although better tutorials probably exist elsewhere). The labs are associated with 3 lectures\r\nintroducing to the basics of OpenGL. The slides are available here:\r\n* [Lecture 1](http://www.ecole.ensicaen.fr/~simonl/files/OpenGL/Cours/Lesson1)\r\n* [Lecture 2](http://www.ecole.ensicaen.fr/~simonl/files/OpenGL/Cours/Lesson2)\r\n* [Lecture 3](http://www.ecole.ensicaen.fr/~simonl/files/OpenGL/Cours/Lesson3)\r\n\r\n# List of labs\r\n* *fromScratch* : an empty project where to implement the first triangle (using the code snippets from the slides)\r\n* *Minimal* : a gap fill project on Back Face Culling, parametric surfaces and depth buffer\r\n* *Texture* : a gap fill project on texture mapping\r\n* *Shading* : a gap fill project on classical illumination shaders (Lambert and Phong) as well as Normal Mapping\r\n* *Mirror*  : a gap fill project on planar mirror (using the stencil buffer)\r\n* *VShadow* : a gap fill project on Shadow Volumes (using the stencil buffer)\r\n* *Game/RubikCube* : a simple Rubik's cube game, meant as an example for the final project.\r\n\r\n# Structure of the labs\r\nA part from the *fromScratch* tutorial which is a standalone lab, and the Rubik's cube, all other labs are structured identically. Each lab is decomposed into a set\r\nof exercises, clearly marked out thanks to c++ comments of the form:\r\n```\r\n/* !todo exercise 1: Short instruction {{{\r\n * A longer (optional) paragraph describing the exercices in more details.\r\n *}}}*/\r\n```\r\nBesides, most of these exercise blocks are placed in *if* statements bound to a global variable state used to switch between the \r\ndifferent exercises at run type (by typing 'E').\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\nThe project relies on the following dependencies\r\n* Cmake 2.8\r\n* OpenGL 3.2\r\n* GLFW 3.0\r\n* GLM 0.9.2\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\n## Building\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nNote: You can add search paths via the standard Cmake variables.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\nAll the labs, must be launched without any optional argument, from the build root (otherwise the assets/shaders will not be found). For example,\r\n```bash\r\n# running the minimal lab:\r\n./Minimial/minimal\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Key bindings:\r\nThe following key bindings are available for all the labs:\r\n* press 'h' to print this message again.\r\n* press 'l' to toggle wireframe.\r\n* press 'c' to toggle between camera and light controls\r\n* press 'r' to reset the light or the camera to its initial position.\r\n* press 'w/s' to move forward/backward :\r\n* press 'a/d' to roll camera (rotation around Z):\r\n* press 'Left/Right' to pan camera (rotation around Y):\r\n* press 'Up/Down' to tilt camera (rotation around X):\r\n* press 'e' to switch to the next exercise:\r\n* press 'E' to switch to the previous  exercise.\r\n* press an integer (in 0:maxExercise)  to switch to the corresponding  exercise.\r\n* press 'q' or Esc to quit.\r\n\r\n## Mouse controls\r\nIf the Picking functionalities are implemented, every object in the scene can be picked. By default, this object will be displayed\r\nin wireframe. As an exception, in the *Vshadow* lab, the object will be selected as the shadow caster. \r\n\r\n# Author and License\r\nPart of this source code has been borrowed and modified from the nice OpenGl Tutorials of [Joe Groff](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html).
